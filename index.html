            This is one of the should be said the only one long lasted game I have ever played in my life.
            <br>Since 2016 when I got my first mobile that was LYF-F8, yes I know it's horrible to hear it now,
          <br>  but at that time it was a pretty decent mobile I had.
            <br>I almost played Clash of Clans for 5yrs upto now and still at ocassions i updgrade my base and
          <br>  it is also pretty fun to play even now.
            <br>I have a decent fully maxed TH10 base(exept the walls and heroes) and its constantly growing.

            Yes! you got this right. As supercell made this game I was so excited to play it the game
            <br>was so nice and the characters and graphics were too good for me, as my device was not decent enough.
            <br>I have played this game for so long until today's day I also have it and do frequently play it.
            <br>I reached in the gold league was very near to the masters but not lucky enough to reach upto it.
            <br>And my card collection is also awesome only 2 cards not available <strong>Ram Rider</strong> and <strong>The Magic Archer.</strong>

            And now story turns to my second Mobile it was Vivo-V3 the 3/32 variant.
            <br>To be very honest I would tell you that i was not a <strong>PUBG</strong> fan,
            <br>ather I disliked it. Beacause, I was very fond of <strong>Fortnite</strong> at that time,
            <br> but as it was not released for android devices at that moment so I tried out PUBG and guess what
            <br> I liked it so much that stopped playing any other games for a month or so.
            <br>I am not a pro, as you guys might be willing to know my tier it is <strong>CROWN-2</strong>
            <br>I am always about to reach Ace Tier but due to several reasons I can't.
            <br>And this time the reason is the next game.

          <br>    Just started playing this due to my friend <strong>Starboy's</strong> recommendation can't talk much about it
          <br>    Just a newbie in it. But this game favored me a lot because it gave me a handy feelig of the
            <br>  keyboard and mouse. So I am very thankful to it.
